Somehow managed to get a force10 e1000 switch to use for a giant LAN party. Long explanation.

This script uses a relatively modular object setup to organize the LAN party by LAN, VLAN, table and switch interface.

Script was designed to play into future scripts to be able to potentially track gaming activity. Should help with balancing the non-switch hardware resources.
